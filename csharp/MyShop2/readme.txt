This is a "shop simulator" that I wrote to practice writing an app that connects to an SQL database.

It has the following functionality:
1. Browse products, add to / remove from a shopping cart, and make a purchase
2. Edit customer records
3. Browse through previous transactions

The app connects to a MySQL database.
Instead of using EF, I wrote raw SQL code to practice writing SQL queries, prepared statements, etc.
