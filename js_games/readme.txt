A few JavaScript mini-games that I wrote while learning. To play, put game files into a directory, then open index.html in a web browser.

Balls: A bouncing ball physics simulator. Alter the gravity and watch what happens.

Bricks: A simple brick-breaking game

Pong: A simple pong game (human vs. computer)

Spaceship: Steer your craft, shoot at aliens, and avoid collision with asteroids

Target practice: Shoot at randomly appearing targets

Waves: Simple demonstration of wave physics
